# Sound Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've successfully integrated sound effects into your TransferBox application. The system now plays audio feedback for success and error events throughout the application.

## 🔊 Sound Triggers

### Error Sound (`error.mp3`) - Plays When:

1. ❌ Transfer fails (any error during transfer)
2. 🚫 Transfer is cancelled by user (Cancel button)
3. 📁 Drive scan finds no valid files (all transfer modes)
4. ⚠️ Drive scan fails (permission errors, etc.)
5. 🔄 Auto-transfer fails (fully-autonomous mode)
6. 💽 Manual drive selection finds no valid files
7. 🛑 Manual drive scan encounters an error

### Success Sound (`success.mp3`) - Plays When:

1. ✅ Transfer completes successfully with no errors

## 📁 Files Modified

### New Files:

- `src/renderer/src/utils/soundManager.ts` - Sound management utility
- `src/renderer/src/assets/error.mp3` - Error sound file
- `src/renderer/src/assets/success.mp3` - Success sound file

### Modified Files:

- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useAppInit.ts` - Added sound triggers for IPC events
- `src/renderer/src/components/TransferProgress.tsx` - Added sound on cancel
- `src/renderer/src/components/DriveSelector.tsx` - Added sound on manual scan
- `src/renderer/src/env.d.ts` - Added TypeScript declarations for MP3 imports

## 🎯 Key Features

1. **Instant Playback**: Sounds are preloaded on app initialization for immediate playback
2. **No IPC Overhead**: Sounds play directly in renderer without main process communication
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If sounds fail to load, app continues working normally
4. **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup on app shutdown
5. **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper type declarations

## ✅ Testing Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All modified files pass validation
- ✅ Sound files properly bundled with Vite
- ✅ Works in both development and production modes

## 🚀 How to Test

### Development Mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Success Sound**:
   - Insert a drive with valid media files
   - Complete a transfer successfully
   - Should hear success.mp3

2. **Error Sound - No Files**:
   - Insert a drive with no media files
   - Should hear error.mp3 immediately after scan

3. **Error Sound - Cancel**:
   - Start a transfer
   - Click "Cancel Transfer" button
   - Should hear error.mp3

4. **Error Sound - Failure**:
   - Start a transfer
   - Simulate an error (e.g., remove destination folder)
   - Should hear error.mp3

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Sound Loading:

- Sounds are imported as ES modules using Vite's asset handling
- Files are automatically bundled with the renderer process
- Audio elements are created with `new Audio(soundFile)`
- Preloaded on app initialization via `audio.load()`

### Architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  useAppInit()   │ ← Initializes sound manager
│                 │ ← Sets up IPC event listeners
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ├─ onTransferComplete → playSuccessSound() or playErrorSound()
         ├─ onTransferError → playErrorSound()
         ├─ onDriveDetected (no files) → playErrorSound()
         └─ onScanError → playErrorSound()

┌─────────────────┐
│ TransferProgress│ ← Cancel button
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         └─ handleCancelTransfer() → stopTransfer() → playErrorSound()

┌─────────────────┐
│ DriveSelector   │ ← Manual scan
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         └─ handleSelectDrive() → scan → playErrorSound() if no files
```

## 📦 Build Notes

- Sound files are copied to `src/renderer/src/assets/`
- Vite automatically handles bundling in production
- No additional configuration needed in electron-builder
- Files are included in the final app bundle

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The sound system is now fully integrated and ready to use. The app will automatically play sounds based on the events described above. No additional configuration is required.

To test it right away, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then insert a drive or trigger any of the scenarios mentioned above!
