## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Security Issues

#### 1.1 Missing IPC Input Validation ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `src/main/ipc.ts`

**Issue:** IPC handlers were accepting raw `unknown` or unvalidated types from the renderer process, potentially allowing malicious input to reach file operations.

**Fix:** Created comprehensive IPC validation utility (`src/main/utils/ipcValidator.ts`) that:
- Validates file paths and prevents path traversal attacks
- Validates device IDs and session IDs
- Validates numeric limits and log levels
- Validates TransferStartRequest structure

**Impact:** All IPC handlers now validate and sanitize inputs before processing, preventing injection attacks and invalid data from corrupting operations.

---

#### 1.2 Command Injection Vulnerabilities ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Locations:** 
- `src/main/pathValidator.ts` - `checkDiskSpaceFallback()`
- `src/main/driveMonitor.ts` - `unmountDrive()`
- `src/main/utils/networkDetector.ts` - Network path detection

**Issue:** Shell commands were constructed using string concatenation with user-controlled paths, allowing potential command injection.

**Examples:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (VULNERABLE)
await execAsync(`df -k "${targetPath}"`)
await execAsync(`diskutil unmount "${mountPoint}"`)
```

**Fix:** Replaced `exec()` with `execFile()` and passed paths as separate arguments:
```typescript
// AFTER (SECURE)
await execFileAsync('df', ['-k', targetPath])
await execFileAsync('diskutil', ['unmount', mountPoint])
```

Also added path validation to reject paths containing command injection characters (`;`, `&`, `|`, `` ` ``, `$`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`).

**Impact:** Eliminates command injection vulnerabilities across all platform-specific command executions.

---

#### 1.3 Path Traversal Prevention ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `src/main/utils/ipcValidator.ts`

**Issue:** File paths from IPC were not validated for path traversal attempts (`../`).

**Fix:** Added `validateFilePath()` function that:
- Normalizes paths
- Rejects paths containing `..`
- Validates path length limits
- Ensures absolute paths when required

**Impact:** Prevents attackers from escaping intended directories and accessing unauthorized files.

---

### 2. Performance Issues

#### 2.1 Progress Reporting Optimization ✅ IMPROVED
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `src/main/fileTransfer.ts`

**Issue:** Progress reporting could cause UI lag with very frequent updates on large files.

**Status:** Already implemented dynamic throttling based on file size, but verification confirms it's working correctly:
- Small files (<100MB): 200ms interval, 2MB minimum
- Medium files (<1GB): 500ms interval, 10MB minimum  
- Large files (<10GB): 1s interval, 50MB minimum
- Very large files (>=10GB): 2s interval, 100MB minimum

**Impact:** UI remains responsive during large file transfers.

---

#### 2.2 Database Query Optimization ✅ VERIFIED
**Severity:** LOW  
**Location:** `src/main/databaseManager.ts`

**Status:** Database queries are already optimized:
- ✅ Using parameterized queries (SQL injection safe)
- ✅ Proper indexes on frequently queried columns (`start_time`, `status`, `session_id`)
- ✅ WAL mode enabled for better concurrent access
- ✅ Foreign keys enabled for data integrity

**No changes needed.**

---

### 3. Data Integrity Issues

#### 3.1 Race Condition: Concurrent Transfer Attempts ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `src/main/ipc.ts` - `TRANSFER_START` handler

**Issue:** Multiple transfer start requests could be processed concurrently, causing:
- Resource conflicts
- State inconsistencies
- Corrupted progress tracking

**Fix:** Added guard clause at start of `TRANSFER_START` handler:
```typescript
// Prevent concurrent transfers
if (transferEngine && transferEngine.isTransferring()) {
  throw new Error('A transfer is already in progress...')
}
```

**Impact:** Ensures only one transfer can be active at a time, preventing state corruption.

---

#### 3.2 Transfer State Detection Improvement ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** LOW  
**Location:** `src/main/fileTransfer.ts` - `isTransferring()`

**Issue:** `isTransferring()` only checked `currentTransfer !== null`, which might miss transfers in progress that haven't set currentTransfer yet.

**Fix:** Enhanced check to also consider active temporary files:
```typescript
isTransferring(): boolean {
  return (this.currentTransfer !== null || this.activeTempFiles.size > 0) && !this.stopped
}
```

**Impact:** More accurate transfer state detection.

---

### 4. Edge Cases

#### 4.1 Large File Array Handling ✅ VERIFIED
**Severity:** LOW  
**Location:** `src/main/utils/ipcValidator.ts`

**Issue:** Extremely large file arrays could cause DoS.

**Fix:** Added limit check in `validateFilePaths()`:
```typescript
if (filePaths.length > 100000) {
  throw new Error('Too many files in transfer request')
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents memory exhaustion from excessive file arrays.

---

#### 4.2 Drive Disconnection Handling ✅ VERIFIED
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `src/main/fileTransfer.ts`, `src/main/errors/TransferError.ts`

**Status:** Already well-handled:
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Proper error categorization (DRIVE_DISCONNECTED vs permanent errors)
- ✅ Atomic file operations (.TBPART pattern) prevent partial corruption
- ✅ Proper cleanup of temp files on error

**No changes needed.**

---

### 5. Code Quality Improvements

#### 5.1 Input Validation Consistency ✅ IMPROVED
**Severity:** LOW  
**Location:** Multiple IPC handlers

**Issue:** Some handlers had validation, others didn't. Inconsistent approach.

**Fix:** Centralized validation in `ipcValidator.ts` utility, applied consistently across all handlers.

**Impact:** Consistent security posture and easier maintenance.

---

#### 5.2 Type Safety Improvements ✅ IMPROVED
**Severity:** LOW  
**Location:** `src/main/ipc.ts`

**Issue:** Some handlers accepted `unknown` but didn't validate before use.

**Fix:** All handlers now explicitly validate inputs and use validated types throughout.

**Impact:** Better type safety and earlier error detection.

---

## Remaining Considerations

### Areas Verified But No Changes Needed

1. **Atomic File Operations**: ✅ Already using `.TBPART` pattern with atomic rename
2. **Checksum Verification**: ✅ Properly implemented with streaming checksums
3. **Error Handling**: ✅ Comprehensive error types and retry logic
4. **Database Transactions**: ✅ Using better-sqlite3 with proper transaction handling
5. **Path Sanitization**: ✅ FilenameUtils handles cross-platform sanitization
6. **Progress Tracking**: ✅ Well-implemented with aggregation for parallel transfers

### Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to IPC handlers to prevent DoS
2. **Input Size Limits**: Add size limits to config updates and other large payloads
3. **Transfer Queue**: Consider implementing a transfer queue for better management
4. **Database Backup**: Consider automatic database backups before destructive operations
5. **Metrics**: Add performance metrics collection for monitoring
